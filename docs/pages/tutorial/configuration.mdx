Before considering the app fully launchable, we have to configure the status bar, add a splash screen, and add an app icon. In this chapter, we will learn how to do all of that.

<Step label="1">

## Configure the status bar

The [`expo-status-bar`](/versions/latest/sdk/status-bar/) library comes pre-installed in every project created using `create-expo-app`. This library provides a `<StatusBar>` component that allows configuring the app's status bar to change the text color, background color, make it translucent, and so on.

Inside **app/index.tsx**:

1. Import `StatusBar` from `expo-status-bar`.
2. Mount the `<StatusBar>` component inside the `Index` component.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx app/index.tsx
// ...rest of the import statements remain same
import { StatusBar } from 'expo-status-bar';

export default function Index() {
  // ...rest of the code remains same

  return (
    <>
      <GestureHandlerRootView style={styles.container}>
        {/* ...rest of the code remains same */}
      </GestureHandlerRootView>
      /* @tutinfo Mount the <CODE>StatusBar</CODE> component and set the <CODE>style</CODE> prop to <CODE>light</CODE>. */
      <StatusBar style="light" />
      /* @end */
    </>
  );
}
```

Let's take a look at our app now on Android, and iOS:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="StatusBar with light style shown on both Android and iOS."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/statusbar-example.png"
  className="max-w-[480px]"
/>

</Step>

<Step label="2">

## Splash screen

A splash screen is a screen that is visible before the contents of the app has had a chance to load. It hides once the app is ready for use and the content is ready to be displayed.

The splash screen is configured by defining a path to the `"splash.image"` property in the [**app.json**](/workflow/configuration/) file. It has a current value of `"./assets/images/splash.png"` path. This is already done by default when a new Expo project is created. We already have **splash.png** in the **assets/images** directory. It looks as shown below:

<ContentSpotlight
  src="/static/images/tutorial/splash.png"
  alt="Custom splash screen used in example app."
  className="max-w-[250px]"
/>

Let's take a look at our app now on Android, and iOS:

<ContentSpotlight file="tutorial/splash-screen.mp4" />

<Collapsible summary="Is the app loading too quickly for you to get a good look at the splash screen?">

You can make the splash screen stick around for longer by manually controlling when it is hidden, rather than the default of automatically hiding it as soon as the app is ready.

Start by running the following command:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo install expo-splash-screen']} />

Next, add the following code in **app/\_layout.tsx** to delay hiding the splash screen for five seconds.

```tsx app/_layout.tsx
import * as SplashScreen from 'expo-splash-screen';

SplashScreen.preventAutoHideAsync();
setTimeout(SplashScreen.hideAsync, 5000);
```

Don't forget to remove this code when you are done testing your splash screen!

</Collapsible>

Notice that there is a white bar on the edges of the Android device in the above demo. Depending on the resolution of the device, there can be a visible white bar on the edges of an Android device's screen. To resolve this, set the `backgroundColor` for the splash screen in **app.json**:

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```json app.json
{
  "splash": {
    "image": "./assets/images/splash.png",
    "resizeMode": "contain",
    /* @tutinfo Use #25292e (black) instead of the default #ffffff (white). */
    "backgroundColor": "#25292e" /* @end */
  }
}
```

The `backgroundColor` value in the above snippet matches the background of the splash screen image.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## App icon

Inside the project, there's an **icon.png** file inside **assets/images** directory. This is our app icon. It's a 1024px by 1024px image and looks as shown below:

<ContentSpotlight src="/static/images/tutorial/icon.png" className="max-w-[150px]" />

Similar to splash screen image, the icon is configured by defining a path to the `"icon"` property in the **app.json** file. It has a current value of `"./assets/images/icon.png"`, so we don't have to change anything.

> Eventually, when you'll build your app for the app stores, [Expo Application Services (EAS)](/eas/) will take this image and create optimized icon for every device.

You can see the icon in various places in Expo Go. Here is an example of the app icon displayed in the developer menu of Expo Go:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="Splash screen on Developer Menu in Expo Go app."
  src="/static/images/tutorial/app-icon-visible.png"
  className="max-w-[250px]"
/>

</Step>

## We have completed the app!

Well done! We built an app that runs on Android, iOS, and the web from the same codebase.
