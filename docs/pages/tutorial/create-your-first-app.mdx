In this chapter, let's learn how to create a new Expo project and how to get it running.

## Prerequisites

We'll need the following to get started:

- Install [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go) on a physical device
- Install Node.js (LTS)
- Run the project locally either on a macOS, Windows (PowerShell and [WSL2](https://expo.fyi/wsl)), or Linux

This tutorial assumes that you have a basic knowledge of TypeScript and React. If you have never written React code, go through [React's official tutorial](https://react.dev/learn) first and for TypeScript, check out the official [TypeScript Handbook](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html).

<Step label="1">

## Initialize a new Expo app

We will use [`create-expo-app`](/more/create-expo/) to initialize a new Expo app. It is a command line tool that allows us to create a new React Native project. Run the following command in your terminal:

<Terminal
  cmd={[
    '# Create a project named StickerSmash',
    '$ npx create-expo-app StickerSmash',
    '',
    '# Navigate to the project directory',
    '$ cd StickerSmash',
  ]}
  cmdCopy="npx create-expo-app StickerSmash --template blank && cd StickerSmash"
/>

This command will create a new project directory with the name **StickerSmash** using the [`default` template](/more/create-expo/#--template). This template comes with essential boilerplate code and libraries such as Expo Router to start building our app. We'll continue to add more libraries throughout this tutorial when needed.

<Collapsible summary={<>Benefits of using the <CODE>default</CODE> template</>}>

- Creates a new React Native project with `expo` package installed
- Includes recommended tools such as Expo CLI
- Includes a tab navigator from Expo Router to provide a basic navigation system
- Automatic setup to run a project on multiple platforms: Android, iOS, and web
- TypeScript configured by default

## Download assets

<BoxLink
  title="Download assets archive"
  Icon={Download03Icon}
  description="We'll be using these assets throughout this tutorial."
  href="/static/images/tutorial/sticker-smash-assets.zip"
/>

After downloading the archive:

1. Unzip the archive and replace the existing **your-project-name/assets/images** directory. This will override the default assets created when the new project was initialized.
2. Open the project directory in a code editor or IDE.

Throughout this tutorial, we will use VS Code for our examples.

</Step>

<Step label="3">

## Run reset-project script

In this tutorial, we will build our app from scratch. This means adding app's navigation and component files to understand the fundamentals of implementing file-based routing. Let's remove the boilerplate code that was created by `create-expo-app` command.

<Terminal cmd={['$ npm run reset-project']} />

After running `reset-project` script, the **app** directory is left with two files (**index.tsx**, and **\_layout.tsx**). Now, we can delete all other files inside the **components**, **constants**, and **hooks** directories since they contain boilerplate code and is not needed for this tutorial.

<Collapsible summary={<>What does the <CODE>reset-project</CODE> script do?</>}>

`reset-project` script resets the **app** directory structure in a project and copies the previous files from **app** directory to another directory called **app-example**. We can delete it since it is not part of our main app's structure.

<Step label="4">

## Run the app on mobile and web

In the project directory, run the following command to start a [development server](/more/glossary-of-terms/#development-server) from the terminal:

<Terminal cmd={['$ npx expo start']} />

After running the above command:

1. The developer server will start and you will see a QR code in the terminal
2. Scan that QR code to open the app on the device. On Android, use the Expo Go > **Scan QR code** option. On iOS, use the default camera app.
3. To run the web app, press <kbd>w</kbd> in the terminal. It will open the web app in the default web browser.

Once it is running on all platforms, the app should look like this:

<ContentSpotlight
  alt="App running on all platforms"
  src="/static/images/tutorial/01-app-running-on-all-platforms.png"
  className="max-w-[720px]"
/>

</Step>

<Step label="5">

## Edit the index screen

Teh text displayed on the app's screen is defined in the **app/index.tsx** file. This file is the entry point of our app and is executed when the development server starts. It uses core React Native components such as `<View>` and `<Text>` to display a background and text.

Styles applied to these components are using JavaScript as compared to web, where CSS web. Most of the React Native components accept a `style` prop that accepts a JavaScript object as its value. For detailed information on styling, see [Styling in React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style).

Let's modify **app/index.tsx** screen:

1. Import `StyleSheet` from `react-native` and create a `styles` object to define our own styles.
2. Add a `styles.container.backgroundColor` property to `<View>` component with the value of `#25292e` to apply the background color.
3. Replace the default value of `<Text>` with "Home screen".
4. Add a `styles.text.color` property to `<Text>` component with the value of `#fff` (white) to change the text color.

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx app/index.tsx|collapseHeight=340
import { Text, View, /* @info Import <CODE>StyleSheet</CODE> to define styles. */ StyleSheet/* @end */ } from 'react-native';

export default function Index() {
  return (
    <View style={styles.container}>
      /* @info This used to say "Edit app/index.tsx to edit this screen". Now it says, "Home screen". */
      <Text style={styles.text}>Home screen</Text>
      /* @end */
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  container: {
    flex: 1,
    /* @info Add the value of <CODE>backgroundColor</CODE> property with <CODE>'#25292e'</CODE>.*/
    backgroundColor: '#25292e',
    /* @end */
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
  },
  text: {
    color: '#fff',
  },
});
```

> React Native uses the same color format as the web. It supports hex triplets (this is what `#fff` is), `rgba`, `hsl`, and a set of named colors like `red`, `green`, `blue`, `peru`, and `papayawhip`. For more information, see [Colors in React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/colors).

This change will reflect on all platforms automatically:

## Next step

We have created a new Expo project, used React Native core components, and are ready to develop our StickerSmash app.
